The user maintenance page shows a list of users and provides buttons to edit and delete users. Currently, these are the only things working for this lab. We
will hand in an updated version tonight, if that is still possible to mark (before 7:30).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATED: Now allows addition and deletion of users. Note that this still doesn't have any login capabilities, so it must be accessed by directly entering the
URL, /usermtce. Also, it's not possible to update user information.
