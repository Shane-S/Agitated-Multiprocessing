We've chosen Kube as the framework for our site. Currently:
*   The appropriate css and scripts are included
*   The user edit page has most of the styles integrated (however, the page is not totally functional...)
*   The field templates are all complete 
*   The formfield_helper is mostly complete (some currently unused views haven't been written)
